            <h3>Breaking News: Birds Stage Mass Protest Demanding Equal Airtime on Television Networks</h3>
               <h4> In a stunning turn of events, birds of all species have united in a mass protest across the globe, demanding equal representation and airtime on television networks. Flocks of birds were seen gathering in major cities, perching atop buildings and trees, and squawking in unison to voice their demands.<br><br>
                The protest, dubbed "Avian Equality Now," has taken flight after years of frustration among the avian community regarding their portrayal in the media. Feathered activists argue that while cats, dogs, and even squirrels dominate the airwaves with their adorable antics, birds are often relegated to mere background scenery or occasional footage during nature documentaries.<br><br>
                "We're tired of being treated like second-class citizens in the media," squawked Polly, a parrot leading the protest in New York City's Central Park. "We have feathers, we have charisma, and we demand to be seen and heard just like any other animal!"<br><br>
                Wings flapping and beaks chirping, the avian demonstrators have presented a list of demands to television networks worldwide, including prime-time slots for bird-focused programming, dedicated channels for bird enthusiasts, and fair representation in advertising campaigns.</h4>
